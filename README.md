It's a Spigot SpeedRunPlugin that uses the Multiverse API to speedrun minecraft on server !
This allows you to use the "/reset" command, wich will regenerate your map without restarting the server or disconnecting any player.

You must have Multiverse-Core v4.1.0 or newer and Multiverse-NetherPortals v.4.2.1 or newer in your plugins folder.
